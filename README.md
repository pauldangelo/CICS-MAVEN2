# CICS-MAVEN2
CICS CICSPLEX MAVEN CICS Explorer
Are there any roadmaps or step-by-step instructions for setting for CICS  Deployment API with CICS Explorer and Maven
.
We have a JVM defined in CICSPLEX and a PROFILE -
In CICS Explorer We have cics-bundle-deploy-reactor-archetype configured and  cics-maven-bundle-plugin ctrated.
We do get some errors in  cics-maven-bundle-plugin.
.
When looking ast the snipets of code in "cics-bundle-maven" its not clearr as to how to proceed -
the snipets and fragements of code are not explained well enough.
.
Are there any step-by-step tutorials setting for CICS Deployment API in CICS Explroer with Maven & CICSPLEX ?
